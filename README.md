Real-Time Speech-to-Sign Language Web Interface

Introduction

This project focuses on enhancing accessibility in virtual meetings by developing a web-based interface that converts spoken conversations into sign language in real-time. While the current implementation is a standalone web application, the project is designed with future plugin integration in mind, allowing for seamless integration into popular meeting platforms like Microsoft Teams or Zoom.

Problem Statement

Many participants in virtual meetings are left out of conversations due to hearing impairments. This project addresses that by providing a real-time translation of spoken words into sign language. Although currently a web-based solution, the project has the potential to evolve into a plugin that can integrate directly with virtual meeting platforms, enabling deaf or hard-of-hearing users to follow conversations effortlessly.

Key Features

Web Interface
Speech-to-Sign Language Translation: Converts spoken words into sign language animations or video representations in real-time.
User-Friendly Interface: The web interface allows users to input speech via a microphone or by typing text, which is then translated into sign language.
Real-Time Processing: Uses speech recognition to process spoken words, translating them instantly into sign language for display.


Project Demonstration

The current project is a web interface that users can interact with to see the real-time translation from spoken language to sign language animations.
How It Works:
Users access the web interface via a browser.
They can either speak into their microphone or type the sentence they wish to translate.
The system performs speech recognition, converts the recognized words into text, and then translates them into corresponding sign language videos.
The user is shown sign language representations of the spoken or typed words in real-time.
